      <p>This is a band that consists of 3 dudes whom I don't remember the names of who make music.<br>I even went to one of their concerts once. That was something.</p>

      <p>Bastille is a band I don't know too much about.<br>I know the singer is a dude and that I've heard of his music through an ad that I thought sounded cool.<br>I haven't listened to them in a while.</p>

      <br>
      <p>I also don't know much about WALK THE MOON. I know that the main singer is a dude.<br>A few years ago we were driving to new york. I was nearly asleep listening to my spotify playlist.<br>But my spotify playlist ended and this song played and I was surprised that this wasn't on my playlist yet.</p>
