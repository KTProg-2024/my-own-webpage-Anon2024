    <h1>My Birthday 3/18</h1>
    <p>Usually when it's my birthday, I would have some sort of birthday party. When I was younger, we would go out shopping for gifts and we would eat at a restaurant I really liked. Places like Rainforest cafe and Texas roadhouse. I remember when I was really young, I was super picky with what I ate. I would have a bad day if I saw butter on a steak I was eating because "I didn't want my food to taste bad". How times have changed.</p>
